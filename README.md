## Code Description
User management using Express, Mongoose, Needle, and MongoDB compass. I used the given json file in the handout for my database where I can get, update, add, and delete entries.

## How to use
Make sure to run "node index.js" then type in the URL for the desired entry to get for example "http://localhost:3000/members" to get all the entries of the database. I have added multiple test files to test each of the POST endpoint like test_save.js for testing of the saving feature so run the test file that is desired to test each of the endpoint.
